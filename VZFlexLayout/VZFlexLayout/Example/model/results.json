               "content":"One of the aspects of building an application is deciding how data will flow through it. Many iOS developers use dictionaries for this purpose, or use handwritten, simple objects instead. We've seen these patterns in our use of Objective-C at Facebook, and we've found some drawbacks in these approaches. Passing dictionaries of data around proved dangerous because dictionary fields are not type-safe. We also found that maintaining custom model objects was time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone.",

We can assume that the difference between these two layouts will be a strong layout.",
