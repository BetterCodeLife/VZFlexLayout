               "content":"One of the aspects of building an application is deciding how data will flow through it. Many iOS developers use dictionaries for this purpose, or use handwritten, simple objects instead. We've seen these patterns in our use of Objective-C at Facebook, and we've found some drawbacks in these approaches. Passing dictionaries of data around proved dangerous because dictionary fields are not type-safe. We also found that maintaining custom model objects was time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone.",

If someone decided to pass an NSNumber as the nickname value, the compiler would successfully build your application, yet a crash would be likely when your app is run. Relying on the compiler is an important part of working in iOS, and the benefits of compile-time errors over runtime errors should not be disregarded.",
