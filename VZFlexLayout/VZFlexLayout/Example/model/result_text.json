Many iOS developers use dictionaries for this purpose, or use handwritten, simple objects instead. We've seen these patterns in our use of Objective-C at Facebook, and we've found some drawbacks in these approaches. Passing dictionaries of data around proved dangerous because dictionary fields are not type-safe. We also found that maintaining custom model objects was time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone.",
